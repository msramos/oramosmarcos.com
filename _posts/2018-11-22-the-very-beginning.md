So this is how it all starts... I guess?

## The very beginning
-----

After a few years wondering if it was time to create a personal blog I finally
did it. I must say a big thank you to all folks from [Ludus](https://ludus.club)
that not only encouraged me to that but also gave me all tools to make this
project real.


What you find in this blog? Well, a lot of tech related stuff for sure, maybe
some personal posts as well... I really don't know. I hope that you enjoy the
content I'll be posting here.

So, let's see what the future brings!
